1. Solution Overview

In order to assist the USDA FS in tracking and tagging areas of interest, TechTrend proposes a next generation augmented reality system. This system will equip field inspectors with a heads-up display providing a real-time, location and position tracked, grid overlay to mark areas of interest for the end-user. Our proposed solution includes the next generation enterprise-grade Augmented Reality platform powered by TechTrend’s Augmented Enterprise Reality (AER) Core. TechTrend developed our AER platform using the ODG’s “smart glasses” which utilize the Reticle operating system. TechTrend maintains a strong relationship with our partners at ODG. We have leveraged that relationship to update our AER Core platform with the latest hardware offered, the ODG R-7 Smart Glasses. Our AER platform combines the flexibility and power of the Android OS with integrated motion sensors to deliver the next generation of user interface and personal computing. AER uses best Android development practices and its customizable interface can integrate different third party APIs, such as Reticle, ODG, and ESRI; with TechTrend developed AER modules to deliver a truly custom framework for Augmented Reality. For the AER integration for USDA FS, TechTrend proposes integrating our AER Core platform with a custom implementation of our AER Plane grid mapping and global positioning module.
